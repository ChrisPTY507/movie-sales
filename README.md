# movie-sales

A little project that i coded back at 2015 when i was still a college student and still learning the basics of Web Development.

Basically, it consists in a simple website that allows the clients to buy or rent movies of several categories. This project only has the Frontend, no backend programming at all.

This whole project was completely done in spanish, and serves me as a reminder of how much i have improved since i started in the world of programming.

To see this simple site, just look for the index.html file and open it with any browser (Google Chrome works best).

It was done ONLY for academic purposes.
